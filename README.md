## Project Details/Overview
Built with Gatsby,this is a static site perfect for aspiring chefs and home cooks who want to share their recipes in a visually appealing and organized way. Chefs can now create a recipe e-book without the need for a database or CMS, making it a lightweight, fast, and easy-to-manage website.


## ðŸš€ Quick start
Navigate into the siteâ€™s directory to start it up. Commands are listed below.
```shell
cd tasty-ebooks/
gatsby develop
```
The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries).
